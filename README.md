Things You Need Before Starting With ROS
Git
```
sudo apt install git
```
VSCode
remote development  extension install
```
sudo snap install --classic code

```
Arduino IDE

The Right Operating System
Each release of ROS is specifically designed to be compatible with a certain release of Ubuntu. For these tutorials weâ€™ll be using ROS Foxy Fitzroy (the latest LTS version), which is only properly compatible with computers running Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa

Other Useful Tools
As we embark on this journey of building our own robots, some other tools that will come in useful are:

12V Bench Power Supply
Battery charger
Multimeter
Soldering iron and solder
Various crimp tools and their connectors (bootlace, spade, JST, etc.)
Various screwdrivers
Rotary Tool/Dremel (hand tools or other power tools can also be used)
3D Printer (this one is definitely optional, you can easily build most projects with no 3D-printed parts)
Portable keyboard/mouse/screen (very optional)
Fasteners and adhesives (cable ties, screws, bolts, tape, etc.)
